# Bridely 👰🏻‍♀️

### This is my Graduation Project in MUST university :) 

##

## Idea 💡

### I have noticed that when there is a bride or grom it wastes too many times to reach the vendors like makeup artist or weeding planner or other vendors.
### Wasting time in social media and contact with them asking them for price and the availability in that day or not.
### So i got an idea to make a single platform where the user can smoothly reach the vendors from different Categories.
### With this platform i will easy to the bride the process of her needs and make the process more quick and Easy.
### Happy Bride :)
